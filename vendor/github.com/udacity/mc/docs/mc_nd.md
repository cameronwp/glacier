## mc nd

Collect and update (some) ND enrollment information for any user

### Synopsis


Check the enrollment info for any student, mentor or not. Additionally,
you can enroll (and unenroll) mentors into nd050.

PS: the '--staging' flag has no effect here - all commands run against
production.

PPS: impersonation does not work here at the moment. You will always run commands as yourself.

```
mc nd [flags]
```

### Options

```
  -h, --help   help for nd
```

### Options inherited from parent commands

```
      --staging   Run against staging environments
```
