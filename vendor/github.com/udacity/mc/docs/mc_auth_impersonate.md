## mc auth impersonate

Perform commands as a different Udacity staff member

### Synopsis


Great for testing and troubleshooting. (You should probably ask the other
person before you impersonate them - it's the polite thing to do.)

CAVEAT: you cannot currently impersonate someone when fetching/updating ND
enrollments or Udacity email addresses. All commands will still work, but those
specific actions will be performed using your credentials, not the impersonatee.

```
mc auth impersonate [flags]
```

### Options

```
  -h, --help   help for impersonate
```

### Options inherited from parent commands

```
      --staging   Run against staging environments
```
